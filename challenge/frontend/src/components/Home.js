      Ho ho ho! It’s Santa here, and let me tell you, times are tough this year.
      The holiday season has been a bit slower than usual, and with expenses
      piling up, I’ve had to get a little creative. You see, I’m not making as
      much money as I used to, what with the rising costs of reindeer feed and
      the upkeep of the North Pole workshop. So, I’ve decided to start renting
      out my reindeer to folks who need a little extra holiday magic.
      They’re trained, they’re strong, and they’ve got the jingle bells to prove
      it! If you need a sleigh ride or some help with your Christmas decorations,
      I’ve got a team ready to spread cheer. Who knew that Santa would be running
      a reindeer rental service? Ho ho ho!
